Part 1/4:

In this part, you will first listen to two 10-minute short stories. Each
story is spoken by a different speaker. You should try to pay attention to each
speakers' voice characteristics. After hearing them, you will be given a short
speaker-recognition test. The first story is spoken by Leon.

Press any key to hear the first story.

You will now listen to the second story, spoken by Jonas. Press any key to hear
it.

You will now do a speaker-recognition test. On each trial, you will hear a
sentence spoken by either of the speakers. Your job is to report that speaker's
name using the number keys on the keyboard (1=Leon, 2=Jonas). You have
unlimited time to respond. If you make a mistake, you will hear the sentence
again, and will get another attempt. A trial is not over until you get the
correct answer.

The test will end after you get 10 trials in a row correct first time, or after
50 trials. Press any key to begin the test.
